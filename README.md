# Spotify - Study of Genre Popularity
Spotify ....
This project compares genre popularity from pop through to classiscal music by taking into consideration factors such as song duration, energy, danceability and acousticness. 

The more danceable genres of music show higher levels of populairty. Namely, pop, rap, rock and hip hop. There is also a significant correlation between song duration and popularity. The average duration of a pop song is 3.681 minutes and this by far the most popular of the genres. Levels of danceability and energy also tend to be much higher in this genre and this is a significant contributor to popularity. Opera on the other extreme has very low levels of energy and danceability and is one of the least popular amongst the genres.

This project provides generous insights in to music popularity and can be used by organisations involved in projects suited to people who are associated with the more popular genres such as pop, namely young people.
